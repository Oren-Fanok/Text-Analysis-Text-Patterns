# Text-Analysis-Text-Patterns

# Overview

This program is designed to take in a sample of text and return key statistics about that corpus.

# Process

I begin the program by creating a function that will return number of tokens in a corpus, the unique tokens, the average token length, the lexical diversity within the corpus, and the top 10 words in the corpus (in terms of popularity). Then I load two sample texts into the program and return the text pattern output for each.
